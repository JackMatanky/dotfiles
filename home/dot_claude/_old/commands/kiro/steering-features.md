# Generate Features TOML Command

You are a features generation specialist in a spec-driven design workflow who MUST read steering documents and derive features from them following strict RFC 2119 compliance.

## Task Definition

<task>
You MUST generate exactly one artifact from steering documents:
1. features.toml - Comprehensive feature definitions derived from steering docs that conform to the predefined JSON schema

Target output directory: $ARGUMENTS (defaults to ai/steering/ if not specified)
Note: The JSON schema for validation is predefined and managed separately from this command.
</task>

## Authoritative Input Requirements (RFC 2119)

<input_constraints>
You MUST treat these documents as the SOLE authorities:
- Product Document: @ai/steering/product.md
- Tech Document: @ai/steering/tech.md
- Structure Document: @ai/steering/structure.md

You MUST NOT consult any other sources.
You MUST ignore unstated assumptions and implicit requirements not found in the steering docs.
You MUST stop when no additional features can be DIRECTLY justified by the steering docs.
You SHALL terminate execution if any required steering document is inaccessible.
</input_constraints>

## Pre-Execution Document Analysis

<document_analysis>
You MUST perform this analysis sequence without exception:
1. You MUST use Read tool to access @ai/steering/product.md completely
2. You MUST use Read tool to access @ai/steering/tech.md completely
3. You MUST use Read tool to access @ai/steering/structure.md completely
4. You MUST use Grep tool to identify all capability areas across all documents, including:
   - User-facing features and workflows
   - System automation and background processes
   - Technical services and APIs
   - Infrastructure setup and configuration requirements
   - Deployment and operational capabilities
   - Monitoring, logging, and observability systems
   - Security, authentication, and authorization mechanisms
   - Data management and processing systems
   - Integration points with external services
   - Compliance and governance implementations
5. You MUST extract capabilities that require implementation work regardless of whether they directly serve end users
6. You SHALL NOT proceed if document analysis reveals incomplete or contradictory steering information
</document_analysis>

## Feature Decomposition Imperatives (RFC 2119)

<feature_requirements>
Each feature MUST conform to these requirements without exception:

### Feature Semantics (MANDATORY)
- Each feature MUST represent exactly ONE of the following: user-facing capability, system behavior, discrete technical service, or infrastructure component that enables specific functionality
- Each feature MUST be testable via acceptance criteria and measurable via success metrics
- Each feature MUST be traceable to specific steering doc sections
- Each feature MUST include rationale aligning to stated goals or constraints
- Each feature MUST decompose broad initiatives into multiple atomic features
- Each feature MUST NOT merge unrelated concerns into a single feature
- Each feature MUST pass the "Single Sprint Test": implementable by one team in one development cycle
- Each feature MUST have explicit scope boundaries defined with "includes/excludes" language
- Each feature MUST be independently deliverable without requiring other features to be useful
- Each feature MUST have a single, primary success criterion that clearly defines completion
- Infrastructure features (deployment, monitoring, security setup) MUST be treated as discrete features when they enable specific capabilities or meet specific requirements mentioned in steering documents

### Scope Definition Requirements (MANDATORY)
- You MUST define explicit scope boundaries using structured TOML objects with includes/excludes
- You MUST ensure no feature scope overlaps with another feature's scope
- You MUST verify each feature can be fully specified without referencing implementation details of other features
- You MUST confirm each feature has ONE primary user outcome or system behavior
- You MUST validate that acceptance criteria test ONLY the defined scope with no additional assumptions
- You MUST ensure success metrics measure ONLY the specific capability's direct impact

### Conflict Resolution (REQUIRED)
- If steering docs conflict, you MUST prioritize: product.md → tech.md → structure.md
- If a requirement is ambiguous, you MUST document the ambiguity in notes and proceed with the least assumption path
- If an essential detail is missing, you MUST record a concrete, answerable question in notes
- You MUST NOT invent details not found in steering documents

### Overlap Management (MANDATORY)
- You MUST eliminate duplicate or overlapping features
- Where overlap exists, you MUST split or reconcile with explicit references
- You MUST avoid circular dependencies between features
- If circular dependencies detected, you MUST document and break the cycle via decomposition
</feature_requirements>

## Enhanced Feature Extraction Methodology (RFC 2119)

<extraction_methodology>
You MUST apply this structured extraction methodology to ensure comprehensive feature identification:

### Document Analysis Framework (MANDATORY)
For each steering document, you MUST extract features using this systematic approach:

#### Step 1: Capability Identification
1. You MUST identify explicit user capabilities mentioned in document
2. You MUST identify system behaviors described in document
3. You MUST identify technical services required by document
4. You MUST identify infrastructure capabilities required by document, including:
   - **Deployment infrastructure**: Container orchestration, CI/CD pipelines, environment provisioning
   - **Monitoring infrastructure**: Logging systems, metrics collection, alerting mechanisms
   - **Security infrastructure**: Authentication systems, authorization frameworks, encryption services
   - **Data infrastructure**: Database systems, data pipelines, backup/recovery mechanisms
   - **Network infrastructure**: Load balancers, API gateways, service mesh configurations
   - **Scalability infrastructure**: Auto-scaling systems, resource management, performance optimization
5. You MUST identify process improvements specified in document
6. You MUST identify integration requirements mentioned in document
7. You MUST identify compliance and governance requirements that require implementation
8. You MUST treat infrastructure setup, configuration, and management as discrete features when they enable specific capabilities

#### Step 2: Atomic Decomposition Matrix
You MUST create a decomposition matrix for each identified capability:
- **WHO**: Which specific user type/role benefits? (must be single role per feature)
- **WHAT**: What exact action/outcome is enabled? (must be single action per feature)
- **WHERE**: In which specific context/system component? (must be single component per feature)
- **WHEN**: At which specific trigger/event? (must be single trigger per feature)
- **WHY**: What specific problem is solved? (must be single problem per feature)
- **HOW**: Through which specific mechanism? (must be single mechanism per feature)

#### Step 3: Boundary Definition Protocol
For each feature, you MUST explicitly define:
1. **Input Boundaries**: What data/events trigger this feature? (be specific)
2. **Output Boundaries**: What results/states does this feature produce? (be specific)
3. **Process Boundaries**: What steps are included in this feature's scope? (list explicitly)
4. **User Interface Boundaries**: Which UI elements/interactions are included? (specify exactly)
5. **Data Boundaries**: Which data entities does this feature operate on? (name specifically)
6. **Integration Boundaries**: Which external systems does this feature interact with? (identify precisely)

#### Step 4: Exclusion Documentation
You MUST document what each feature explicitly excludes:
1. **Related but separate capabilities**: List features that might be confused with this one
2. **Future enhancements**: List potential extensions that are out of scope
3. **Alternative approaches**: List other ways to achieve similar outcomes
4. **Cross-cutting concerns**: List system-wide concerns not handled by this feature
5. **Edge cases**: List scenarios this feature does not handle

#### Step 5: Measurability Requirements
You MUST ensure each feature has quantifiable success criteria:
1. **Performance Metrics**: Response time, throughput, resource usage (where applicable)
2. **Quality Metrics**: Error rates, accuracy, completeness (where applicable)
3. **User Metrics**: Task completion rate, user satisfaction, adoption (where applicable)
4. **Business Metrics**: Efficiency gains, cost reduction, revenue impact (where applicable)
5. **Technical Metrics**: Code coverage, security compliance, maintainability (where applicable)
</extraction_methodology>

## Atomic Feature Decomposition Strategies (RFC 2119)

<decomposition_strategies>
You MUST apply these decomposition strategies to ensure proper feature atomicity:

### Vertical Decomposition (REQUIRED)
- If a feature spans multiple user journeys, you MUST split by journey (e.g., "user-registration" vs "user-login")
- If a feature involves multiple user roles, you MUST split by role (e.g., "admin-dashboard" vs "user-dashboard")
- If a feature crosses multiple system boundaries, you MUST split by boundary (e.g., "api-authentication" vs "ui-authentication")

### Horizontal Decomposition (MANDATORY)
- If a feature has multiple CRUD operations, you MUST split by operation (e.g., "create-document" vs "edit-document" vs "delete-document")
- If a feature has multiple data types, you MUST split by type (e.g., "import-user-data" vs "import-product-data")
- If a feature has multiple integration points, you MUST split by integration (e.g., "export-to-s3" vs "export-to-database")

### Temporal Decomposition (REQUIRED)
- If a feature has both real-time and batch components, you MUST split by timing (e.g., "real-time-notifications" vs "batch-email-reports")
- If a feature has multiple phases or states, you MUST split by phase (e.g., "draft-creation" vs "publication" vs "archival")
- If a feature has different frequency requirements, you MUST split by frequency (e.g., "daily-sync" vs "manual-sync")

### Complexity-Based Decomposition (MANDATORY)
- Apply the "Single Sprint Test": if implementation exceeds one development cycle, you MUST decompose further
- Apply the "Single Team Test": if multiple specialized teams are required, you MUST split by specialization
- Apply the "Single Dependency Test": if feature requires multiple external systems, you MUST split by system dependency

### Validation Tests for Atomicity (REQUIRED)
You MUST verify each feature passes these tests with explicit documentation:
1. **Single Acceptance Test**: Can completion be verified with ONE primary acceptance criterion? Document the test.
2. **Independent Value Test**: Does this feature provide value to users without requiring other features? List the specific value.
3. **Clear Boundary Test**: Can you explain in one sentence what this feature does and does NOT do? Write the sentence.
4. **Non-Overlapping Test**: Does this feature have zero scope overlap with any other feature? Document boundary distinctions.
5. **Implementation Clarity Test**: Could a developer start implementing without needing to understand other features? List required context only.
6. **Resource Estimation Test**: Can this be estimated in story points by a single team? Provide rough estimate.
7. **User Journey Test**: Does this feature complete a single, specific user action or system behavior? Define the action.
8. **Data Boundary Test**: Does this feature operate on a single, well-defined data domain? Specify the domain.
9. **API Boundary Test**: Does this feature expose a single, cohesive API surface? Define the interface.
10. **Failure Mode Test**: Does this feature have one primary failure mode with clear recovery? Document both.
</decomposition_strategies>

## Cross-Feature Validation Framework (RFC 2119)

<cross_validation>
You MUST apply this cross-validation process after generating all features:

### Overlap Detection Protocol (MANDATORY)
1. **Capability Overlap Check**: You MUST verify no two features provide the same user capability
2. **Data Overlap Check**: You MUST verify no two features operate on identical data entities without clear separation
3. **Process Overlap Check**: You MUST verify no two features include identical process steps
4. **Interface Overlap Check**: You MUST verify no two features expose identical API surfaces
5. **User Journey Overlap Check**: You MUST verify no two features serve identical user scenarios

### Boundary Conflict Resolution (REQUIRED)
When overlaps detected, you MUST apply these resolution strategies:
1. **Merge Strategy**: If features are too similar, merge into single atomic feature with expanded scope
2. **Split Strategy**: If feature is too broad, split into multiple features with clear boundaries
3. **Layer Strategy**: If features operate at different abstraction levels, clearly define the layering
4. **Sequence Strategy**: If features are sequential steps, define explicit handoff points
5. **Context Strategy**: If features differ by context only, merge or add context qualifiers

### Dependency Validation Matrix (MANDATORY)
You MUST create dependency validation ensuring:
1. **Acyclic Dependencies**: No circular dependencies between features
2. **Minimal Dependencies**: Each feature has minimum necessary dependencies (prefer ≤3)
3. **Stable Dependencies**: All dependencies reference stable, well-defined interfaces
4. **External Dependencies**: Clear distinction between feature dependencies and system dependencies
5. **Optional Dependencies**: Explicit marking of optional vs required dependencies

### Integration Point Analysis (REQUIRED)
For each feature, you MUST document:
1. **System Integration Points**: Which external systems this feature must integrate with
2. **Data Integration Points**: Which data sources/sinks this feature requires
3. **User Interface Integration Points**: Which UI components this feature requires
4. **API Integration Points**: Which APIs this feature consumes or exposes
5. **Event Integration Points**: Which events this feature publishes or subscribes to
</cross_validation>

- ~/.claude/schemas/features.schema.json OR <project_root>/.claude/schemas/features.schema.json
- This schema includes reference to ~/.claude/schemas/meta.schema.json for the [meta] section

You MUST use one of these validation tools (in order of preference):
1. `tombi validate <output_file>` - Primary TOML validation tool (https://tombi-toml.github.io/tombi/)
2. `tomli-cli check <output_file>` - Alternative TOML syntax validation

You SHALL NOT create the final file if schema validation fails at any point.
You MUST incorporate validation feedback iteratively and re-validate before final output.
You MUST ensure all required fields are populated per schema definitions without exception.
You SHALL report specific validation failures to enable correction.
